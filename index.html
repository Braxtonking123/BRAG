            <div id="ceramic-bio">High tech ceramic tinting is a premium window film that uses non-metal, non-conductive ceramic particles to block UV rays, heat, and glare. It offers superior performance in terms of heat rejection, reducing the interior temperature significantly while maintaining a clear view from the inside. Ceramic tints do not interfere with electronic signals such as GPS, mobile devices, or radios, making them ideal for modern vehicles. They also provide excellent UV protection, blocking up to 99% of harmful rays, which helps protect both passengers and the car’s interior from fading</div>

            <div id="carbon-header">Carbon Tinting</div>
            <div id="carbon-bio">Carbon tinting is a durable, non-metallic option that uses carbon particles to create a matte finish. It offers effective heat and UV protection, keeping the interior cool while preventing sun damage. Unlike metallic films, carbon tint doesn’t interfere with electronic signals, and its deep color provides a sleek, non-reflective look. Carbon tints are known for their long-lasting quality, as they resist fading over time. Although they don’t block as much heat as ceramic tints, they are a cost-effective alternative with solid overall performance</div>

                <div class="review">They replaced two windows for me and tinted them to match the rest of my car. They made sure to get all the glass out from the previous broken window that had fallen all over in my car. We were able to wait in their comfortable waiting room. They had all the streaming services and were very accommodating. I felt like they did an amazing job and had very good customer service. Would highly recommended!</div>

I was LUCKY (as lucky gets when hitting animals) to have hit it a just few miles out from Tremonton and Bear River. It was a Saturday afternoon and they went above and beyond to help get my windshield replaced and get me back on the road or I’d have been stuck in Utah till Monday. They are genuinely good people and a great business!</div>
